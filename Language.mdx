### Image Types

When querying for images in our API, the behavior of image path fields `poster_path`, `backdrop_path`, and `still_path` varies based on language preferences, availability, and fallback logic. Below is a detailed explanation of how each field operates:

**Poster_path**

- **Language Priority:** The system first attempts to retrieve the poster in the language specified in your query (e.g., `en` or `fr`).

- **Fallback Mechanism:**

  - If no poster exists in the requested language, it defaults to the highest-rated poster in the media's original language, if available.

  - If neither is found, it falls back to the overall highest-rated poster, regardless of language.

- **Regional Variants:** Although the language query parameter supports regional lookups (e.g., `en-US` or `fr-CA`), regional variants for images are not currently supported. This functionality is planned for a future update.

**Backdrop_path**

- **Language Consideration:** Most backdrops lack a specific language designation. As a result, the default behavior is to return the highest-rated backdrop with no language specified.

- **Fallback:** If no language-agnostic backdrop is available, the system returns the overall highest-rated backdrop, regardless of language.

**Still_path**

- **TV Episode Images:** Similar to backdrops, still images for TV episodes do not inherently have associated languages.

- **Query Behavior:** The system retrieves the highest-rated still image available, with no language-based filtering applied.
