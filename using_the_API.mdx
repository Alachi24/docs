`append_to_response` is an easy and efficient way to append extra requests to any top level namespace. The movie, TV show, TV season, TV episode and person detail methods all support a query parameter called `append_to_response`. This makes it possible to make sub requests within the same namespace in a single HTTP request. Each request will get appended to the response as a new JSON object.

Here's a quick example, let's assume you want the movie details and the videos for a movie. Usually you would think you have to issue two requests:

```examples
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11/videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

But with append_to_response you can issue a single request:

```examples
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

Even more powerful, you can issue multiple requests, just comma separate the values:

```examples
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?append_to_response=videos,images' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
```

<Note>
  Each method will still respond to whatever query parameters are supported by
  each individual request. This is worth pointing out specifically for images
  since your language parameter will filter images. This is where the
  `include_image_language` parameter can be useful as outlined in the image
  language page.
