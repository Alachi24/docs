### Image Types

When querying for images in our API, the behavior of image path fields `poster_path`, `backdrop_path`, and `still_path` varies based on language preferences, availability, and fallback logic. Below is a detailed explanation of how each field operates:

**Poster_path**

- **Language Priority:** The system first attempts to retrieve the poster in the language specified in your query (e.g., `en` or `fr`).

- **Fallback Mechanism:**

  - If no poster exists in the requested language, it defaults to the highest-rated poster in the media's original language, if available.

  - If neither is found, it falls back to the overall highest-rated poster, regardless of language.

- **Regional Variants:** Although the language query parameter supports regional lookups (e.g., `en-US` or `fr-CA`), regional variants for images are not currently supported. This functionality is planned for a future update.

**Backdrop_path**

- **Language Consideration:** Most backdrops lack a specific language designation. As a result, the default behavior is to return the highest-rated backdrop with no language specified.

- **Fallback:** If no language-agnostic backdrop is available, the system returns the overall highest-rated backdrop, regardless of language.

**Still_path**

- **TV Episode Images:** Similar to backdrops, still images for TV episodes do not inherently have associated languages.

- **Query Behavior:** The system retrieves the highest-rated still image available, with no language-based filtering applied.

<Note>
  When querying `/images`, the language parameter filters by language tags. Use
  `include_image_language` to add images from other languages or untagged ones.
  Take a look below where we give an example of requesting the images tagged
  with English and also those not tagged with any language.
</Note>

```Example_getting_English_&_no_language_images
  curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550/images?language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

Notice the `include_image_language` parameter. This query (`en`,`null`) is looking for all images that match English and those that haven't been set yet (null).

Better yet, you can do query this image method in a single request by using `append_to_response`:

```Example_with_append_to_response
  curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?append_to_response=images&language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
