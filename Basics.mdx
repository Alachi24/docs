Movie, TV, and person objects in our API include references to various file paths for images. To construct a fully functional image URL, you'll need three key components: a `base_url`, a `file_size`, and a `file_path`.

The base_url and file_size are obtained via the [/configuration](https://chisa.mintlify.app/api-reference/configuration/details) API endpoint, while the file_path is specific to the media object you're querying. For example, if a movie returns a poster_path of `/1E5baAaEse26fej7uHcjOgEE2t2.jpg` and you want the w500 size, the complete image URL would combine these elements accordingly.

```Example
    https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/1E5baAaEse26fej7uHcjOgEE2t2.jpg
```

Logos for companies and networks come in two versatile formats: SVG and PNG, giving you options to suit your project's needs. By default, the `logo_path` field in our API responses delivers a `.png` file. Why? This design choice ensures **backward compatibility**, as SVG support was added after the initial system rollout—keeping everything running smoothly for existing setups.

When you dive into the image methods, you'll spot a handy new field: `file_type`. This little gem reveals the original format of the uploaded logo asset, making it easy to pick the right approach:

- **SVG Logos:** If file_type flags an SVG, you're working with a scalable file that our system doesn't resize. For the best results, request the original size when fetching these. It's the perfect way to leverage SVG's crisp, scalable goodness.

- **PNG Logos:** For PNGs, flexibility is the name of the game. The `file_type` confirms it's a PNG, and you can request any available size you'd like—our system resizes these from the original upload to fit your needs.

This setup empowers you to select the format and size that works best for your application, all while keeping compatibility locked in for seamless integration.

Take for instance Netflix's logo (`wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.svg`), you can call any of the following:

```Example
    https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.svg
    https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.png
    https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wwemzKWzjKYJFfCeiB57q3r4Bcm.png
```
