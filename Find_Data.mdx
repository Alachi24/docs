There are 3 ways to search for and find movies, TV shows and people on TMDB. They're outlined below.

- `/search` - The most common search method. Provide a query string, and we'll return the closest match, considering all original, translated, and alternative names and titles.
- `/discover` - Search for movies and TV shows using filters like ratings, certifications, or release dates. This method makes it easy to find content based on specific criteria.
- `/find` - Use existing external IDs, such as IMDB IDs, to find matching movies, TV shows, or people. Useful for integrating with other tools and services.

Take a look at the [search & query for details]() page for some basic workflows you might use to search and query data.
